<h1>Readme of 4geeks full Stack developer bootcamp</h1>
This is the repository of my full stack developer bootcamp than I study in 4 geeks academy. I begin this bootcamp in 27 march of 2023 and it will end in july of the same year, but before to start the bootcamp, I have a prework to do, and here you can see the projects than I make.
<h2>Prework</h2>
<h3>Postal card</h3>
The first project is a postal card. It's easy for me, because I have used flex(I love flexbox!) and I ended so fast.
<h3>Simple instagram Photo Feed</h3>
The first "problem" than I found here is than I have to search my images and I don't see if the images are at the same size, but with width, all is ok. 
When I saw the exercise, I noticed in the text with #. And remember the pseudoselectors in CSS, so I take me as a challenge, select the 4 #, in 4 differents ways, and I did it!
Another thing than I have made in this project is the comments, to explain and make more clear the code, than I think than is important.
With this two projects I end the part of HTML and CSS. The next is JS!
